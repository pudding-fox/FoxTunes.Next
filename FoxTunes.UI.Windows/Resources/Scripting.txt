FoxTunes - Scripting

Scripts are written in JavaScript. They are a single expression and must return a value:

tag.title

If multiple statements are required, wrap them in a function an execute it:

(function () {
    var title = [tag.title || strings.general_notitle];
    return title;
})()

Values are grouped by cartegory:
1) tag
2) property
3) document
4) file
5) folder

Depending on your settings, more or less values are available:

    if (energy && energy.energyLevel) {
        return energy.energyLevel;
    }
    return strings.general_unknown;
